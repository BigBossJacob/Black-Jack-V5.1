# Black-Jack-V5.1
ADDED: --Buttons less likely to be bugged --Button UI more friendly on game scene

Welcome to Black Jack 5.0! This edition of the game is a reimagining of the 3.3 edition and a remaster of the 4.1 edition (long since privated due to bug issues). You start with 50$ and play against a single dealer, but don't go bankrupt! See if you can beat the game testers' high scores! Check in the future for more updates. Meant for Corona SDK, written in Lua. If there are any issues or bugs, or you just want to try and modify for the better, just send a pull request.
